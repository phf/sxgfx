# Quick X Graphics

What's the quickest (aka simplest) way to put some graphics on the screen
under X?
I wasn't sure either, so I decided to try a few different approaches, all
from C of course.
Since it doesn't really matter what exactly we draw, I cloned the classic
"Boxes" demo from the early Amiga days.

Enjoy!
